## Performance of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Machine Learning

This repository includes key features and concepts for my dissertation. Due to confidential reason, I only include a demonstration of applying TDA on **one** time series dataset taken from [UCR Time Series Classification Archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/).

The goal of the dissertation is to compare and contrast the performance of TDA and ML as applied to cluster and classify time series data. 
The title of the dissertation: **An exploration in comparing topological data analysis and machine learning analysis on time series data**

## Key Approaches 

- Literature Review 
  - Persistent homology, Takens embedding, persistence images, dimension reduction (t-SNE, UMAP, SOM), clustering (K-means, HDBSCAN, Hierarchical, Spectral), classificaiton (KNN)
- Design workflow
